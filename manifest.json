	"description": "Claude AI powered vault assistant that can edit, create, and delete notes across your entire vault using natural language. The focus of this plugin is fast and easy editing of 1 or more notes via quick one-off prompt submissions, not chatting with your notes. There is no chat interface, just a modal to submit prompts. This makes for really simple but powerful edits. Ex: \"Find all the tasks I didn't complete in the last 3 daily notes and copy them to today's daily note\". Web search tools are enabled for Claude, so it can also find information from the open internet to include in notes.",
